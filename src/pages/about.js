    <Text>
      My name is Tom, I'm 25 years old and I live in Brno, Czech Republic. I am
      a passionate self-taught frontend developer with a tremendous love for
      creating beautiful things with code.
      <br />
      <br /> My primary focus is JavaScript (working mainly with React and
      Vue.js in my free time) but as of right now, I work full time as a Web
      Designer/Frontend Coder at Monster Worldwide here in Brno, where I deal
      with creating premium job ads and company brandings for customers from
      Germany, Switzerland and Austria.
      <br />
      <br /> Apart from coding I love sports, music and educating myself about
      web development and life in general.
